## Project Purpose

This project demonstrates proficiency in LC-3 assembly programming by:
- Accepting five test scores as user input
- Calculating and displaying the **minimum**, **maximum**, and **average** scores
- Determining the letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) for each test score
- Utilizing subroutines and branching for modular design

## Programmers

- Troy Reindl
- Ellie Chang

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: LC-3 Assembly
- **Tools**: LC-3 Simulator, Text Editor

## Features

- Input validation for test scores
- Calculation of:
  - **Minimum score**
  - **Maximum score**
  - **Average score**
- Display of:
  - Each score and corresponding letter grade
  - Messages and prompts
- Option to restart the program
- Error handling for invalid inputs and stack overflows

## Usage

1. Assemble and load the program into an LC-3 simulator (e.g., LC3Edit, PennSim).
2. Run the program and follow the prompts:
   - Enter five test scores (0â€“99).
   - The program displays the letter grade for each score.
   - The program then calculates and displays:
     - Minimum score
     - Maximum score
     - Average score
3. When prompted, press **Y** to run the program again or **N** to exit.
